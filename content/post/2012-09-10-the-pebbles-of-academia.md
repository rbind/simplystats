I have just been awarded a certificate for successful completion of the Conflict of Interest Commitment training (I barely passed). Lately, I have been totally swamped by administrative duties and have had little time for actual research. The experience reminded me of something I read in this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/29/business/economy/29view.html?_r=1" target="_blank">NYTimes article</a> by <span><a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/" target="_blank">Tyler Cowen</a></span>

> <span>Michael Mandel, an economist with the Progressive Policy Institute, compares government regulation of innovation to the accumulation of pebbles in a stream. At some point too many pebbles block off the water flow, yet no single pebble is to blame for the slowdown. Right now the pebbles are limiting investment in future innovation.</span>

Here are some of the pebbles of my academic career (past and present): <span>financial conflict of interest training , human subjects training, HIPAA training, safety training, ethics training, submitting papers online, filling out copyright forms, faculty meetings, center grant quarterly meetings, 2 hour oral exams, 2 hour thesis committee meetings, big project conference calls, retreats, JSM, anything with &#8220;strategic&#8221; in the title, admissions committee, </span><span>affirmative action committee, faculty senate meetings, brown bag lunches, orientations, effort reporting, conflict of interest reporting, progress reports (can&#8217;t I just point to pubmed?), dbgap progress reports, people who ramble at study section, rambling at study section, </span>buying airplane tickets for invited talks, filling out travel expense sheets, and organizing and turning in travel receipts. I know that some of these are somewhat important or take minimal time, but read the quote again.

I also acknowledge that I actually have it real easy compared to others so I am interested in hearing about other people&#8217;s pebbles?
