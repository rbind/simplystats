There&#8217;s in interesting discussion over at reddit on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/mhodz/data_scientist_vs_statistician/" target="_blank">the difference between a data scientist and a statistician</a>. My crude summary of the discussion seems to be that by and large they are the same but the phrase &#8220;data scientist&#8221; is just the hip new name for statistician that will probably sound stupid 5 years from now.

My question is why isn&#8217;t &#8220;statistician&#8221; hip? The comments don&#8217;t seem to address that much (although a few go in that direction). There a few interesting comments about computing. For example from ByteMining:

> Statisticians typically don&#8217;t care about performance or coding style as long as it gets a result. A loop within a loop within a loop is all the same as an O(1) lookup.<br />

Another more down-to-earth comment comes from marshallp:

> There is a real distinction between data scientist and statistician
> 
>   * the statistician spent years banging his/her head against blackboards full of math notation to get a modestly paid job
> 
>   * the data scientist gets s&#8212;loads of cash after having learnt a scripting language and an api
> 
> More people should be encouraged into data science and not pointless years of stats classes

Not sure I fully agree but I see where he&#8217;s coming from!
