<span>A week ago, Nate Silver tweeted this:</span>

> <span>Since Lin became starting PG, Knicks have outscored opponents by 63 with Novak on the floor. Been outscored by 8 when he isn&#8217;t.</span>

In a <a href="http://simplystatistics.tumblr.com/post/16974142373/why-dont-we-hear-more-about-adrian-dantley-on-espn" target="_blank">previous post</a> we showed the plot below. Note that Carmelo Anthony is in ball hog territory. Novak plays the same position as Anthony but is a three point specialist. His career three point FG% of 42% (253-603) puts him **10th all time!** It seems that with Lin in the lineup he is getting more open shots and helping his team. Should the Knicks start Novak? 

Hat tip to David Santiago.
