The NBA season is over and, once again, what I will most remember are King James' heroics.
As a lifelong Boston Celtics fan, I am supposed to hate LeBron James. But I don't. As a fan of the game of basketball, and a statistician, I just can't help but be in awe of the best player ever to play the game. Also how can you hate this guy (don't miss the wrist watch)?

```{r young-lebron, echo=FALSE,  out.width='25%'}
knitr::include_graphics("http://n.sinaimg.cn/sinacn/w600h686/20180104/c476-fyqinct9321280.jpg")
```

Of all the ridiculous stats one can rattle about LeBron, to me, the most impressive actually relate to a simple one: career totals. The graph below shows you his total points, assists, steals and rebounds as a function of time. The consistency, durability, and all-around production is simply unprecedented.
At 33, he is already top 25 **all time** in three categories: points, assists and steals. If he can keep up his current pace for five more years (I know it's a big _if_), he will be **top 3** in points, assists and steals, and top 25 in rebounds. No other player comes close.  

```{r king-james-totals, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(rvest)
url <- "http://www.espn.com/nba/player/stats/_/id/1966/lebron-james"
h <- read_html(url)
lebron <-html_nodes(h, "table") %>% .[[3]] %>% rvest::html_table(fill=TRUE)
names(lebron) <- lebron[2,]
lebron <-lebron[3:17,1:17]
ind <- 11:17
lebron[ ,ind] <- apply(lebron[,ind], 2, as.numeric)

stats <- c("pts","ast","stl","trb")
full_stats <- c("Points", "Assists", "Steals", "Rebounds")
urls <- paste0("https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/",
              stats, "_career.html")
tabs <- lapply(urls, function(url){
  tab <- read_html(url) %>%
    html_nodes("table") %>%
    .[[2]] %>%
    html_table()
   tab <- tab %>% mutate(Player = gsub("\\*", "", Player))
   names(tab)[3] <- "Value"
   tab
})
names(tabs) <- stats
names(lebron)[11] <- "TRB"
ind <- match(toupper(stats), names(lebron))

rafalib::mypar(2,2)
for(i in seq_along(stats)){
  y <- lebron[[ ind[i] ]]
  r <- mean(y)
  x <- 2004:2018

  YLIM <- c(min(y), max(tabs[[i]]$Value))
  YLIM[2] <- YLIM[2]*(1.05)
  XLIM <- c(min(x), 2018 + 5)
  plot(x, cumsum(y), xlim = XLIM, ylim = YLIM, xaxt="n",
       main = full_stats[i], xlab="", ylab="Total")
  axis(side=1, 2004:2023, 2004:2023, las =2)
  abline(-2003*r, r, lty = 2, col = "red")
  j <- c(1:3,25)
  the_names <- tabs[[i]]$Player[j]
  the_names[4] <- paste0("Top 25")
  z <-  tabs[[i]]$Value[j]
  abline(h = z, lty = 2)
  text(2008.5, z, the_names, pos=3, offset = 0.1, cex = 0.7)
}
```

Here is the code that produces the graph above:

```{r eval=FALSE}

h <- read_html(url)

names(lebron) <- lebron[2,]
lebron <-lebron[3:17,1:17]
ind <- 11:17
lebron[ ,ind] <- apply(lebron[,ind], 2, as.numeric)

stats <- c("pts","ast","stl","trb")
full_stats <- c("Points", "Assists", "Steals", "Rebounds")
urls <- paste0("https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/",
              stats, "_career.html")
tabs <- lapply(urls, function(url){
  tab <- read_html(url) %>%
    html_nodes("table") %>%
    .[[2]] %>%
    html_table()
   tab <- tab %>% mutate(Player = gsub("\\*", "", Player))
   names(tab)[3] <- "Value"
   tab
})
names(tabs) <- stats
names(lebron)[11] <- "TRB"
ind <- match(toupper(stats), names(lebron))

rafalib::mypar(2,2)
for(i in seq_along(stats)){
  y <- lebron[[ ind[i] ]]
  r <- mean(y)
  x <- 2004:2018

  YLIM <- c(min(y), max(tabs[[i]]$Value))
  YLIM[2] <- YLIM[2]*(1.05)
  XLIM <- c(min(x), 2018 + 5)
  plot(x, cumsum(y), xlim = XLIM, ylim = YLIM, xaxt="n",
       main = full_stats[i], xlab="", ylab="Total")
  axis(side=1, 2004:2023, 2004:2023, las =2)
  abline(-2003*r, r, lty = 2, col = "red")
  j <- c(1:3,25)
  the_names <- tabs[[i]]$Player[j]
  the_names[4] <- paste0("Top 25")
  z <-  tabs[[i]]$Value[j]
  abline(h = z, lty = 2)
  text(2008.5, z, the_names, pos=3, offset = 0.1, cex = 0.7)
}
```
