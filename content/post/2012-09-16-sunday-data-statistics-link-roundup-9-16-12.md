  1. There has been a lot of talk about the Michael Lewis (of Moneyball fame) <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/2012/10/michael-lewis-profile-barack-obama" target="_blank">profile of Obama </a>in Vanity fair. One interesting quote I think deserves a lot more discussion is: &#8220;<span>On top of all of this, after you have made your decision, you need to feign total certainty about it. People being led do not want to think probabilistically.&#8221; This is a key issue that is only going to get worse going forward. All of public policy is probabilistic - we are even moving to <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/jun/20/test-policies-randomised-controlled-trials" target="_blank">clinical trials to evaluate public policy</a>. </span>
  2. It&#8217;s sort of amazing to me that I hadn&#8217;t heard about this before, but a <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevensalzberg/2012/08/25/uc-davis-threatens-professor-for-writing-about-psa-testing/" target="_blank">UC Davis professor was threatened</a> for discussing the reasons PSA screening may be overused. This same issue keeps coming up over and over - <a href="http://www.statschat.org.nz/2012/09/14/screening-isnt-treatment-or-prevention/" target="_blank">screening healthy populations for rare diseases is often not effective</a> (you need a ridiculously high specificity or a treatment with almost no side effects). What we need is John McGready to do a claymation public service video or something explaining the reasons screening might not be a good idea to the general public. 
  3. A bleg - I sometimes have a good week finding links myself and there are a few folks who regularly send links (Andrew J., Alex N., etc.) I&#8217;d love it if people would send me cool links when they see them with the email title, &#8220;Sunday LInks&#8221; - i&#8217;m sure there is more cool stuff out there. 
  4. The ICSB has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Computational_Biology/ISCB_competition_announcement" target="_blank">a competition</a> to improve the coverage of computational biology on Wikipedia. Someone should write a <a href="http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.0030161" target="_blank">surrogate variable analysis</a> or <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12925520" target="_blank">robust multiarray average article.</a> 
  5. I had not hear of the ASA&#8217;s <a href="http://stattrak.amstat.org/" target="_blank">Stattrak</a> until this week, it looks like there are some useful resources there for early career statisticians. With the onset of fall, it is closing in on a new recruiting season. If you are a postdoc/student on the job market and you haven&#8217;t read Rafa&#8217;s post on <a href="http://simplystatistics.org/post/14454324191/on-hard-and-soft-money" target="_blank">soft vs. hard money</a>, now is the time to start brushing up! Stay tuned for more job market posts this fall from Simply Statistics.
