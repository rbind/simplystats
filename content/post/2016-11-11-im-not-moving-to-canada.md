Dear Lab Members,

I know that the results of Tuesday's election have many of you
concerned about your future. You are not alone. I am concerned
about my future as well. But I want you to know that I have no plans
of going anywhere and I intend to dedicate as much time to our
projects as I always have. Meeting, discussing ideas and putting them
into practice with you is, by far, the best part of my job. 

We are all concerned that if certain campaign promises are kept many
of our fellow citizens may need our help. If this happens, then we
will pause to do whatever we can to help. But I am currently
cautiously optimistic that we will be able to continue focusing on
helping society in the best way we know how: by doing scientific
research.

This week Dr. Francis Collins assured us that there is strong
bipartisan support for scientific research. As an example consider
[this op-ed](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/22/opinion/double-the-nih-budget.html?_r=0)
in which Newt Gingrich advocates for doubling the NIH budget. There
also seems to be wide consensus in this country that scientific
research is highly beneficial to society and an understanding that to
do the best research we need the best of the best no matter their
gender, race, religion or country of origin. Nothing good comes from
creative, intelligent, dedicated people leaving science. 

I know there is much uncertainty but, as of now, there is nothing stopping us
from continuing to work hard. My plan is to do just that and I hope
you join me.
