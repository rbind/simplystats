People who read the news should be aware by now that we are in the midst of a big data era. The New York Times, for example, has been writing about this frequently. One of their most recent <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/01/science/simons-foundation-chooses-uc-berkeley-for-computing-center.html" target="_blank">articles</a> describes how UC Berkeley is getting $60 million dollars for a <span>new </span>computer science center. Meanwhile, at University of Florida the administration seems to be oblivious to all this and about a month ago announced it was dropping its computer science department to save $. <a href="http://blogs.forbes.com/stevensalzberg/" target="_blank">Blogger</a> <a href="http://bioinformatics.igm.jhmi.edu/salzberg/Salzberg/Salzberg_Lab_Home.html" target="_blank">Steven Salzberg</a>, a computational biologists known for his <a href="http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sUVeH-4AAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">work in genomics</a>, wrote a post titled &#8220;<a href="http://genome.fieldofscience.com/2012/04/university-of-florida-eliminates.html" target="_blank">University of Florida eliminates Computer Science Department. At least they still have football</a>&#8221; ridiculing UF for their decisions. Here are my favorite quotes:

> <span> in the midst of a technology revolution, with a shortage of engineers and computer scientists, UF decides to cut computer science completely? </span>

> Computer scientist Carl de Boor, a member of the National Academy of Sciences and winner of the 2003 National Medal of Science, asked the UF president &#8220;What were you thinking?&#8221;

Well, his post went viral and days later <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevensalzberg/2012/04/25/university-of-florida-announces-plan-to-save-computer-science-department/" target="_blank">UF reversed it&#8217;s decision</a>! So my point is this: statistics departments, be nice to bloggers that work in genomics&#8230; one of them might save your butt some day.
