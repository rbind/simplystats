When colleagues with young children seeking information about schools
ask me if I like the Massachusetts public school my
children attend, my answer is always the same: "it's great...except for
math". The fact is that in our household we supplement our kids' math
education with significant extra curricular work in order to ensure
that they receive a math education comparable to what we received as
children in the public system. 
 
The latest results from the Program for International Student
Assessment (PISA)
[results](http://www.businessinsider.com/pisa-worldwide-ranking-of-math-science-reading-skills-2016-12)
show that there is a general problem with math education in the
US. Were it a country, Massachusetts would have been in second place
in reading, sixth in science, but 20th in math, only ten points above
the OECD average of 490. The US as a whole did not fair nearly as well
as MA, and the same discrepancy between math and the other two
subjects was present. In fact, among the top 30 performing
countries ranked by their average of science and reading scores, the
US has, by far, the largest discrepancy between math and 
the other two subjects tested by PISA. The difference of 27 was
substantially greater than the second largest difference, 
which came from Finland at 17. Massachusetts had a difference of 28.

If we look at the trend of this difference since PISA was started 16
years ago, we see a disturbing progression. While science and reading
have
[remained stable, math has declined](http://www.artofteachingscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Screen-Shot-2013-12-17-at-9.28.38-PM.png). In
2000 the difference between the results in math and the other subjects
was only 8.5. Furthermore,
the US is not performing exceptionally well in any subject:

So what is going on? I'd love to read theories in the comment
section. From my experience comparing my kids' public schools now
with those that I attended, I have one theory of my own. When I was a
kid there was a math textbook. Even when a teacher was bad, it
provided structure and an organized alternative for learning on your
own.  Today this approach is seen as being "algorithmic" and has fallen
out of favor. "Project based learning" coupled with group activities have
become popular replacements. 
 
Project based learning is great in principle. But, speaking from 
experience, I can say it is very hard to come up with good projects,
even for highly trained mathematical minds.  And it is certainly much
more time consuming for the instructor than following a
textbook. Teachers don't have more time now than they did 30 years ago
so it is no surprise that this new more open approach leads to
improvisation and mediocre lessons. A recent example of a pointless
math project involved 5th graders picking a number and preparing a
colorful poster showing "interesting" facts about this number. To
make things worse in terms of math skills, students are often rewarded 
for effort, while correctness is secondary and often disregarded. 
 
Regardless of the reason for the decline, given the trends
we are seeing, we need to rethink the approach to math education. Math
education may have had its problems in the past, but recent evidence
suggests that the reforms of the past few decades seem to have
only worsened the situation.
