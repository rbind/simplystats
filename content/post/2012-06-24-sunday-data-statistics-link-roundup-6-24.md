  1. We&#8217;ve got a new domain! You can still follow us on tumblr or here: <a href="http://simplystatistics.org/" target="_blank"><a href="http://simplystatistics.org/" target="_blank">http://simplystatistics.org/</a></a>. 
  2. A <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/1824499/sports-data-analytics-mit-sloan-goldsberry" target="_blank">cool article</a> on MIT&#8217;s annual sports statistics conference (via <a href="https://twitter.com/storeylab" target="_blank">@storeylab</a>). I love how the guy they chose to highlight created what I would consider a pretty simple visualization with known tools - but it turns out it is potentially a really new way of evaluating the shooting range of basketball players. This is my favorite kind of creativity in statistics.
  3. This is an interesting article calling higher education a &#8220;<a href="http://nplusonemag.com/death-by-degrees" target="_blank">credentials cartel</a>&#8221;. I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;d go quite that far; there are a lot of really good reasons for higher education institutions beyond credentialing like research, putting smart students together in classes and dorms, broadening experiences etc. But I still think there is room for a smart group of statisticians/computer scientists to solve the <a href="http://simplystatistics.org/post/16759359088/why-in-person-education-isnt-dead-yet-but-a" target="_blank">credentialing problem</a> on a big scale and have a huge impact on the education industry. 
  4. Check out John Cook&#8217;s <a href="http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2012/06/18/methods-that-get-used/" target="_blank">conjecture</a> on statistical methods that get used: &#8220;<span>The probability of a method being used drops by at least a factor of 2 for every parameter that has to be determined by trial-and-error.&#8221; I&#8217;m with you. I wonder if there is a corollary related to how easy the documentation is to read? </span>
  5. If you haven&#8217;t read Roger&#8217;s post on <a href="http://simplystatistics.org/post/25643791866/statistics-and-the-science-club" target="_blank">Statistics and the Science Club</a>, I consider it a must-read for anyone who is affiliated with a statistics/biostatistics department. We&#8217;ve had feedback by email/on twitter from other folks who are moving toward a more science oriented statistical culture. We&#8217;d love to hear from more folks with this same attitude/inclination/approach.
