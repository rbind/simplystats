The very very cool UCLA <a href="http://datafest.stat.ucla.edu/groups/datafest/" target="_blank">Data Fest</a> is going on as we speak. This is a statistical analysis marathon where teams of undergrads work through the night (and day) to address an important problem through data analysis. Last year they looked at crime data from the Los Angeles Police Department. I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing how this year goes.

Great work by <a href="http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~rgould/Home/About_Me.html" target="_blank">Rob Gould</a> and the <a href="http://www.stat.ucla.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Statistics</a> there.
