  1. <a href="http://www.robertniles.com/stats/" target="_blank">Statistics help for journalists</a> (don&#8217;t forget to keep <a href="http://www.healthnewsrater.com/" target="_blank">rating stories</a>!) This is the kind of thing that could grow into a statisteracy page. The author also has a really nice <a href="http://www.sensibletalk.com/journals/robertniles/201110/84/" target="_blank">plug for public schools</a>. 
  2. An interactive graphic to determine <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/01/15/business/one-percent-map.html" target="_blank">if you are in the 1%</a> from the New York Times (I&#8217;m not&#8230;).
  3. Mike Bostock&#8217;s <a href="http://mbostock.github.com/d3/talk/20110921/#0" target="_blank">d3.js presentation</a>, this is some really impressive visualization software. You have to change the slide numbers manually but it is totally worth it. Check out <a href="http://mbostock.github.com/d3/talk/20110921/#10" target="_blank">slide 10</a> and <a href="http://mbostock.github.com/d3/talk/20110921/#14" target="_blank">slide 14</a>. This is the future of data visualization. Here is a beginners <a href="http://www.drewconway.com/zia/?p=2857" target="_blank">tutorial</a> to d3.js by Mike Dewar.
  4. An online diagnosis prediction start-up (<a href="http://symcat.com/" target="_blank">Symcat</a>) based on data analysis from two Hopkins Med students.

Finally, a bit of a bleg. I&#8217;m going to try to make this link roundup a regular post. If you have ideas for links I should include, tweet us @simplystats or send them to Jeff&#8217;s email.
