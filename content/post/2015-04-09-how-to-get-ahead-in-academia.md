This video on how to make it in academia was produced over 10 years ago by Steven Goodman for the ENAR Junior Researchers Workshop. Now the whole world can benefit from its wisdom.

The movie features current and former JHU Biostatistics faculty, including Francesca Dominici, Giovanni Parmigiani, Scott Zeger, and Tom Louis. You don't want to miss Scott Zeger's secret formula for getting promoted!
