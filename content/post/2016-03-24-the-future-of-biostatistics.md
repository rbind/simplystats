Starting in January my colleague [Dimitris Rizopoulos](https://twitter.com/drizopoulos) and I took over as co-editors of the journal
Biostatistics. We are pretty fired up to try some new things with the journal and to make sure that the most important advances
in statistical methodology and application have a good home. 

We started a blog for the journal and our first post is here: [The future of Biostatistics](https://medium.com/@biostatistics/the-future-of-biostatistics-5aa8246e14b4#.uk1gat5sr). Thanks to [Karl Broman
and his famiy](https://twitter.com/kwbroman/status/695306823365169154) we also have the twitter handle [@biostatistics](https://twitter.com/biostatistics). Follow us there to hear about all the new stuff we are rolling out.
