I dislike violin plots because they look like Christmas ornaments.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.height=3}
knitr::include_graphics("http://fullhdwall.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Beautiful-Christmas-Ornaments.jpg")
```


```{r, echo=FALSE,  message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
theme_set(theme_bw())
set.seed(3)
N <- 1000
p <- 25
dat <- matrix(rnorm(N*p, 0, 1.5), p, N) + rnorm(p, 25, 1)
rownames(dat) <- LETTERS[1:p]
z <- rbinom(p, 1, prob = c(0.7, 0.3))
dat[7,] <- z*rnorm(N, 27, 0.5) + (1-z)*rnorm(N, 24, 1) 
dat <- gather(data.frame(t(dat), stringsAsFactors = FALSE), group, value)
```
It's a pet peeve but there is somewhat a practical reason as well. To demonstrate I created a dataset called `dat` that contains an outcome `value` for from `r p` different groups.

One of the first steps I take when analyzing data is to look at the distribution of my data. If there are groups, I like to stratify and look at the distributions. Histograms and smooth density estimates are my favorite tools for visualizing distributions. I have `r p` groups in this data so I would start by quickly looking at a random subset:  

```{r histograms, fig.height=2.5}
dat %>% filter(group %in% c("A","H","I","P")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(value)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5, color="black") +
  facet_grid(.~group)
```

This plot shows me that the data looks normally distributed. To see how the groups compare to each other, a first step is to look at boxplots with groups reordered by their median value.

```{r boxplots,fig.height=2.5}
dat %>% mutate(group = reorder(group, value, median)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(group, value)) + geom_boxplot()
```

If you look close enough you note that group G looks a bit different: larger variance. But by summarizing into only five numbers, the boxplot misses an important characteristic of the data. Violin points lets you see the distributions rather than these five points:

```{r violin,fig.height=2.5}
dat %>% mutate(group = reorder(group, value, median)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(group, value)) + geom_violin(fill = "blue")
```

Do you see it? If you look closely group G appears to be bimodal. But why is it hard for me to see?

1. Adding a mirror image of the density to make them resemble boxplots in some manner makes them look like Christmas ornaments and distracts me.
2. I am used to looking at histograms and densities with the variable in the x-axis not the y-axis.

I therefore prefer to stack histograms or density estimators vertically. So I was happy to learn about the [ggjoy](https://github.com/clauswilke/ggjoy) package that let's you make such a plot in one line of code and produces a much more aesthetically pleasing plot than stacking histograms using, for example, facets.
 

```{r joy, fig.height=7, fig.width=4, fig.align='center'}
library(ggjoy)
dat %>% mutate(group = reorder(group, value, median)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=value, y=group, height=..density..)) +
  geom_joy(scale=0.85)
``` 

Note how quickly we notice the bimodal group. I am hoping people start using joy plots instead of violin plots. Try out the package:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("clauswilke/ggjoy")
```
