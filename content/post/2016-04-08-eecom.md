I just read Karl's [great
post](https://kbroman.wordpress.com/2016/04/08/i-am-a-data-scientist/)
on what it means to be a data scientist. I can't really add much to
it, but reading it got me thinking about the Apollo 12 mission, the
second moon landing. 

This mission is actually famous because of its launch, where the
Saturn V was struck by lightning and [John
Aaron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Aaron) (played wonderfully
by Loren Dean in the movie [Apollo
13](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112384/)), the flight controller in
charge of environmental, electrical, and consumables (EECOM), had to
make a decision about whether to abort the launch.

In this great clip from the movie *Failure is Not An Option*, the real
John Aaron describes what makes for a good EECOM flight
controller. The bottom line is that

> A good EECOM has a natural curiosity for how things work, even if you...are not responsible for them

I think a good data scientist or statistician also has that
property. They key part of that line is the "*even if you are not
responsible for them"* part. I've found that a lot of being a
statistician involves nosing around in places where you're not
supposed to be, seeing how data are collected, handled, managed,
analyzed, and reported. Focusing on the development and implementation
of methods is not enough.

Here's the clip, which describes the famous "SCE to AUX" call from
John Aaron:
