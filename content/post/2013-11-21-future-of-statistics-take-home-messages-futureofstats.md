A couple weeks ago we had the Future of Statistics Unconference. [You can still watch it online here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4UJjzuYjfM). Rafa also attended the [Future of Statistical Sciences Workshop](http://www.statistics2013.org/presentations-and-panelists/) and wrote a [great summary which you can read here](http://simplystatistics.org/2013/11/18/feeling-optimistic-after-the-future-of-the-statistical-sciences-workshop/).

I decided to write a summary of take home messages from our speakers at the Unconference. [You can read it on Github here](https://github.com/jtleek/futureofstats/blob/master/README.md). I put it on Github for two reasons:

  1. I agree with Hadley's statement that the future of statistics is on Github.
  2. I summarized them based on my interpretation and would love collaboration on the document. If you want to add your new thoughts/summaries, add a new section with your bullet pointed ideas and send me a pull request!

I sent our speakers a gift for presenting in the Unconference (if you were a speaker and didn't get yours, email me!). Hadley posted the front on Twitter. Here is the back:

    P.S. Stay tuned for the future of Simply Statistics Unconferences.
