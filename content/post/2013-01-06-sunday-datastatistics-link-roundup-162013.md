  1. Not really statistics, but this is [an interesting article](http://www.science20.com/hammock_physicist/rational_suckers-99998) about how rational optimization by individual actors does not always lead to an optimal solutio<span style="line-height: 24px;">h</span>n. Related, ere is the [coolest street sign](http://www.businessinsider.com/16-ways-asian-cities-are-making-their-us-counterparts-look-like-the-third-world-2013-1#some-japanese-street-signs-have-heat-maps-to-relay-congestion-information-to-drivers-and-directly-influence-traffic-patterns-3) I think I've ever seen, with a heatmap of traffic density to try to influence commuters.
  2. An [interesting paper](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1205.4891v1.pdf) that talks about how clustering is only a really hard problem when there aren't obvious clusters. I was a little disappointed in the paper, because it defines the "obviousness" of clusters only theoretically by a distance metric. There is very little discussion of the practical distance/visual distance metrics people use when looking at clustering dendograms, etc.
  3. A post about the [two cultures of statistical learning](http://norvig.com/chomsky.html) and a [related post](http://www.r-bloggers.com/data-driven-science-is-a-failure-of-imagination/) on how data-driven science is a failure of imagination. I think in both cases, it is worth pointing out that [the only good data science is good science](http://simplystatistics.org/2012/12/31/what-makes-a-good-data-scientist/) - i.e. it seeks to answer a real, specific question through the scientific method. However, I think for many modern scientific problems it is pretty naive to think we will be able to come to a full, mechanistic understanding complete with tidy theorems that describe all the properties of the system. I think the real failure of imagination is to think that science/statistics/mathematics won't change to tackle the realistic challenges posed in solving modern scientific problems.
  4. A graph that shows the incredibly strong correlation ( > 0.99!) between the [growth of autism diagnoses and organic food sales](http://boingboing.net/2013/01/01/correlation-between-autism-dia.html). Another example where even really strong correlation does not imply causation.
  5. The Buffalo Bills are going to start an [advanced analytics department](http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000121055/article/buffalo-bills-to-start-advanced-analytics-department) (via Rafa and Chris V.), maybe they can take advantage of all this [free play-by-play data](http://www.advancednflstats.com/2010/04/play-by-play-data.html) from years of NFL games.
  6. A [prescient interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJAIERgWhZQ) with Isaac Asimov on learning, predicting the Kahn Academy, MOOCs and other developments in online learning (via Rafa and Marginal Revolution).
  7. [The statistical software signal](http://seanjtaylor.com/post/39573264781/the-statistics-software-signal) - what your choice of software says about you. Just another reason we need a [deterministic statistical machine](http://simplystatistics.org/2012/08/27/a-deterministic-statistical-machine/).
