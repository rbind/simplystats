Our previous post on <a href="http://simplystatistics.tumblr.com/post/10764298034/the-future-of-graduate-education" target="_blank">future of (statistics) graduate education</a> was motivated by  he Stanford <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/16/science/16stanford.html?_r=1" target="_blank">online course</a> on Artificial Intelligence.  Here is <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2012/01/23/udacity-and-the-future-of-online-universities/" target="_blank">an update</a> on the class that had 160,000 people enroll. Some highlights: 1- Sebastian Thrun has given up his tenure at Stanford and he’s started a new online university called <a href="http://www.udacity.com/" target="_blank">Udacity</a>. 2- 248 students got a perfect score: they never got a single question wrong, over the entire course of the class. All 248 took the course online; not one was enrolled at Stanford. 3- Students from Afghanistan completed the course. What do you think are the chances these students could afford Stanford&#8217;s tuition? 4 - There were more students from Lithuania alone than there are students at Stanford altogether.

The <a href="http://programming-puzzler.blogspot.com/2011/11/review-of-2011-free-stanford-online.html" target="_blank">class evaluations were not perfect</a>. Here is <a href="http://pennyhacks.com/2011/12/28/stanford-free-classes-a-review-from-a-stanford-student/" target="_blank">a particularly harsh one</a>. They also need to figure out how to evaluate online students. But I am sure there are plenty of people working on that problem. Here is an <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/MIT-Mints-a-Valuable-New-Form/130410/?sid=at" target="_blank">example</a>. Regardless, this was the first such experiment and for a first try it seems like a huge success to me. As more professors try this, for example Harvard&#8217;s Gary King is conducting a <a href="http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/gov2001" target="_blank">similar class </a>in Quantitative Research Methodology, it will become clearer that there is no future for in-class lectures as we know them today.

Thanks to Alex and Jeff for all the links.
