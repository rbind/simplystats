In <a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2011/11/college-has-been-oversold.html" target="_blank">this post</a> Alex Tabarrok argues that not enough people are obtaining &#8220;degrees that pay&#8221; and that college has been oversold. It struck me that the number of students studying Visual and Performing Arts has more than doubled since 1985. Yet for Math and Statistics there has been no increase at all! We need to do a better job at marketing. The great majority (if not all) of the people I know with Statistics degrees have found a job related to Statistics. With a Master&#8217;s, salary can be as high as <a href="http://www.payscale.com/research/US/Degree=Master_of_Science_(MS),_Statistics/Salary" target="_blank">$110K</a>.So to those interested in Visual and Performing Arts that are good with numbers I suggest you hedge your bets: do a double major and consider Statistics. My <a href="https://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=5049582229" target="_blank">brother</a>, a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx_sPV04Img" target="_blank">successful</a> musician, majored in Math. He uses his math skills to supplement his income by playing poker with other musicians.
