<a title="Mark Hansen" href="http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~cocteau/" target="_blank">Mark Hansen</a> is easily one of my favorite statisticians today. He is a Professor of Statistics at <a href="http://www.stat.ucla.edu/" target="_blank">UCLA</a> and his collaborations with artists have brought data visualization to a whole new place, one that is both informative and moving. 

Here is a video of his project with Ben Rubin called Listening Post. The installation grabs conversations from unrestricted chat rooms and processes them in real-time to create interesting &#8220;themes&#8221; or &#8220;movements&#8221;. I believe this one is called &#8220;I am&#8221; and the video is taken from the Whitney Museum of American Art.

Here some pretty cool time-lapse photography of the installation of Listening Post at the San Jose Museum of Art
