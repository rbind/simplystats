In the latest episode of Not So Standard Deviations Hilary and I talk about the motivation behind the [explainr](https://github.com/hilaryparker/explainr) package and the general usefulness of automated reporting and interpretation of statistical tests. Also, Roger struggles to come up with a quick and easy way to explain why statistics is useful when it sometimes doesn't produce any different results.
