It&#8217;s worth following up a little on why the Obama campaign is recruiting statisticians (note to Karen: I am not looking for a new job!). Here&#8217;s the blurb for the position of &#8220;Statistical Modeling Analyst&#8221;:

> The Obama for America Analytics Department analyzes the campaign&#8217;s data to guide election strategy and develop quantitative, actionable insights that drive our decision-making. Our team&#8217;s products help direct work on the ground, online and on the air. We are a multi-disciplinary team of statisticians, mathematicians, software developers, general analysts and organizers - all striving for a single goal: re-electing President Obama. We are looking for staff at all levels to join our department from now through Election Day 2012 at our Chicago, IL headquarters.

>   Statistical Modeling Analysts are charged with predicting electoral outcomes using statistical models. These models will be instrumental in helping the campaign determine how to most effectively use its resources.

>   The Obama campaign didn&#8217;t invent the idea of heavy data analysis in campaigns, but they seem to be heavy adopters. There are 3 openings in the &#8220;Analytics&#8221; category as of today.
