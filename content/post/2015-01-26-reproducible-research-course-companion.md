The purpose of this e-book is pretty simple. The book provides all of the key video lectures from my <a title="JHU/Coursera Reproducible Research Course " href="https://www.coursera.org/course/repdata" target="_blank">Reproducible Research course</a> offered on Coursera, in a simple offline e-book format. The book can be viewed on a Mac, iPad, or iPad mini.

If you're interested in taking my Reproducible Research course on Coursera and would like a flavor of what the course will be like, then you can view the lectures through the book (the free sample contains three lectures). On the other hand, if you already took the course and would like access to the lecture material afterwards, then this might be a useful add-on. If you care currently enrolled in the course, then this could be a handy way for you to take the lectures on the road with you.

Please note that all of the lectures are still available for free on YouTube via my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZA0RbbSK1IXeeJysKYRWuQ" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>. Also, the book provides content only. If you wish to actually complete the course, you must take it through the Coursera web site.
