That has got to be the best reason to <a href="http://simplystatistics.org/post/28335633068/why-im-staying-in-academia" target="_blank">stay in academia.</a> The meetings where it is just you and a bunch of really smart people thinking about tackling a new project, coming up with cool ideas, and dreaming about how you can really change the way the world works are so much fun.

There is no part of a research job that is better as far as I&#8217;m concerned.  It is always downhill after that, you start <a href="http://simplystatistics.org/post/31281359451/the-pebbles-of-academia" target="_blank">running into pebbles</a>, your code doesn&#8217;t work, or <a href="http://simplystatistics.org/post/26977029850/my-worst-recent-experience-with-peer-review" target="_blank">your paper gets rejected</a>. But that first blissful planning meeting always seems so full of potential.

Just had a great one like that and am full of optimism.
