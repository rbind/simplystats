I just uploaded Episode 3 of [Not So Standard Deviations](https://soundcloud.com/nssd-podcast) so check your feeds. In this episode Hilary and I talk about our jobs and the life of the data scientist in both academia and the tech industry. It turns out that they're not as different as I would have thought.
