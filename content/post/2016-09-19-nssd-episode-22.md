Hilary and I celebrate our one year anniversary doing the podcast together by discussing whether there are cities that are good for data scientists, reproducible research, and professionalizing data science.

Also, Hilary and I have just published a new book, [Conversations on Data Science](https://leanpub.com/conversationsondatascience?utm_source=SimplyStats&utm_campaign=NSSD&utm_medium=BlogPost), which collects some of our episodes in an easy-to-read format. The book is available from Leanpub and will be updated as we record more episodes. If you're new to the podcast, this is a good way to do some catching up!
