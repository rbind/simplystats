  1. A really nice <a href="http://alignedleft.com/tutorials/d3/" target="_blank">D3 tutorial</a>. I&#8217;m 100% on board with D3, if they could figure out a way to export the graphics as pdfs, I think this would be the best visualization tool out there.
  2. A <a href="http://populationaction.org/Articles/Whats_Your_Number/" target="_blank">personalized calculator</a> that tells you what number (of the 7 billion or so) that you are based on your birth day. I&#8217;m person 4,590,743,884. Makes me feel so special&#8230;.
  3. An old post of ours, on <a href="http://simplystatistics.tumblr.com/post/10555655037/dongle-communism" target="_blank">dongle communism</a>. One of my favorite posts, it came out before we had much traffic but deserves more attention.
  4. This isn&#8217;t statistics/data related but too good to pass up. From the Bones television show, <a href="http://www.myvidster.com/video/4132893/_A_new_low_for_TV_science_Malware_Fractals_in_Bones_ampbull_videosiftcom" target="_blank">malware fractals shaved into a bone</a>. I love TV science. Thanks to Dr. J for the link.
  5. <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/26/what-are-the-odds-that-stats-would-get-this-popular/" target="_blank">Stats are popular</a>&#8230;
