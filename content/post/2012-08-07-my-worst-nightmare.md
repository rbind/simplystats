I don&#8217;t know if you have <a href="http://www.emptyage.com/post/28679875595/yes-i-was-hacked-hard" target="_blank">seen this</a> about a person who&#8217;s iCloud account was hacked. But man does it freak me out. As a person who relies pretty heavily on cloud-based storage devices and does some cloud-computing based research as well, this is a pretty freaky scenario. Time to go back everything up again&#8230;
