In this episode of the Simply Statistics podcast Jeff and I discuss the deterministic statistical machine and increasing the cost of data analysis. We decided to eschew the studio setup this time and attempt a more guerilla style of podcasting. Also, Rafa was nowhere to be found when we recorded so you’ll have to catch his melodious singing voice in the next episode.

And in case you’re wondering, Jeff’s office is in fact that clean.

As always, we welcome your feedback!
