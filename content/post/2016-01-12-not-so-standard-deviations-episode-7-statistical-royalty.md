The latest episode of Not So Standard Deviations is out, and boy does Hilary have a story to tell.

We also talk about Theranos and the pitfalls of diagnostic testing, Spotify's Discover Weekly playlist generation algorithm (and the need for human product managers), and of course, a little Star Wars. Also, Hilary and I start a new segment where we each give some "free advertising" to something interesting that they think other people should know about.
