This year I recorded my lectures during my Statistics for Genomics course. Slowly but surely I am putting all the videos on Youtube. Links will eventually be <a href="http://rafalab.jhsph.edu/688/" target="_blank">here</a> (all slides and the first lecture is already up).  As new lectures become available I will post updates on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/RafaLab/144709675562592" target="_blank">rafalab&#8217;s facebook page</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/rafalab" target="_blank">twitter feed</a> where I will answer questions posted as comments (time permitting). Guest lecturers include Jeff Leek, Ben Langmead, Kasper Hansen and Hongkai Ji.
