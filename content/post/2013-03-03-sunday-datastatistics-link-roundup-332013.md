  1. [A really nice example](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1200303) where epidemiological studies are later confirmed by a randomized trial. From a statistician's point of view, this is the idealized way that science would work. First, data that are relatively cheap (observational/retrospective studies) are used to identify potential associations of interest. After a number of these studies show a similar effect, a randomized study is performed to confirm what we suspected from the cheaper studies.
  2. Joe Blitzstein talking about the "[Soul of Statistics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=dzFf3r1yph8#)", [we interviewed](http://simplystatistics.org/2012/01/20/interview-with-joe-blitzstein/) Joe a while ago. Teaching statistics is critical for modern citizenship. It is not just about learning which formula to plug a number into - [it is about critical thinking with data](http://citizen-statistician.org/2013/03/02/wall-street-journal/). Joe's talk nails this issue.
  3. Significance magazine has a [writing contest](http://www.significancemagazine.org/details/webexclusive/4374981/Writing-with-Significance-Writing-competition-to-celebrate-the-International-Yea.html#.USSXc5Hslzc.twitter). If you are a grad student in statistics/biostatistics this is an awesome way to (a) practice explaining your discipline to people who are not experts - a hugely important skill and (b) get your name out there, which will help when it comes time to look for jobs/apply for awards, etc.
  4. A great post from David Spiegelhalter about the UK court's [interpretation of probability](http://understandinguncertainty.org/court-appeal-bans-bayesian-probability-and-sherlock-holmes). It reminds me of the Supreme Court's recent decision that also [hinged on a statistical interpretation](http://simplystatistics.org/2011/12/12/the-supreme-courts-interpretation-of-statistical/).  This post brings up two issues I think are worth a more in-depth discussion. One is that it is pretty clear that many court decisions are going to [hinge on statistical arguments](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/02/john-roberts-voting-rights-act_n_2797127.html). This suggests (among other things) that statistical training should be mandatory in legal education. The second issue is a minor disagreement I have with Spiegelhalter's characterization that only Bayesians use epistemic uncertainty. I frequently discuss this type of uncertainty in my classes although I take a primarily frequentist/classical approach to teaching these courses.
  5. Thomas Lumley is [giving an online course](http://www.statistics.com/survey-r/) in complex surveys.
  6. [On the protective value of an umbrella](http://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/refs/umbrellas_and_lions.pdf) when encountering a lion. Seems like a nice way to wrap up a post that started with the power of epidemiology and clinical trials. (via [Karl B.](https://twitter.com/kwbroman))
