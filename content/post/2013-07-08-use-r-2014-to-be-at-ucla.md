The [2014 Use R! conference](http://user2014.stat.ucla.edu) will be in Los Angeles, CA and will be hosted by the [UCLA Department of Statistics](http://www.stat.ucla.edu) (an excellent department, I must say) and the newly created [Foundation for Open Access Statistics](http://www.foastat.org). This is basically _the_ meeting for R users and developers and has grown to be quite an event.
