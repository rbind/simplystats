Today marks the first Simply Statistics course offering happening over at Coursera. I&#8217;ll be teaching <a href="https://class.coursera.org/compdata-2012-001/" target="_blank">Computing for Data Analysis</a> over the next four weeks. There&#8217;s still plenty of time to register if you are interested in learning about R and the activity on the discussion forums is already quite vibrant.

Also starting today is my colleague Brian Caffo&#8217;s <a href="https://class.coursera.org/biostats-2012-001/class/index" target="_blank">Mathematical Biostatistics Bootcamp</a>, which I hear also has had an energetic start. With any luck, the students in that class may get to see Brian dressed in military fatigues.

This is my first MOOC so I have no idea how it will go. But I&#8217;m excited to start and am looking forward to the next four weeks.
