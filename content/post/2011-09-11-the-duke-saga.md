For those of you that don&#8217;t know about the saga involving genomic signatures, I highly recommend reading this <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21528593" target="_blank">very good summary</a> published in The Economist. Baggerly and Coombes are two statisticians that can confidently say they have made an impact on clinical research and actually saved lives. A paper by this pair describing the details was published in the <a href="http://www.e-publications.org/ims/submission/index.php/AOAS/user/submissionFile/5816?confirm=cfad51b7" target="_blank">Annals of Applied Statistics</a> as most of the Biology journals refused to publish their letters to the editor. Baggerly is also a fantastic public speaker as seen in <a href="http://vimeo.com/16698764" target="_blank">this video</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1MT0oZqPXY" target="_blank">this one</a>.
