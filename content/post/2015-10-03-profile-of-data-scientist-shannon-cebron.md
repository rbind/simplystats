The "This is Statistics" campaign has a nice [profile of Shannon Cebron](http://thisisstatistics.org/interview-with-shannon-cebron-from-pegged-software/), a data scientist working at the Baltimore-based Pegged Software.

> Take some advanced statistics courses if you want to see what it’s like to be a statistician or data scientist. By that point, you’ll be familiar with enough statistical methods to begin solving real-world problems and understanding the power of statistical science.  I didn’t realize I wanted to be a data scientist until I took more advanced statistics courses, around my third year as an undergraduate math major.
