Here&#8217;s a claim for which I have absolutely no data: I believe I am more productive with a smaller screen/monitor. I have a 13&#8221; MacBook Air that I occasionally hook up to a 21-inch external monitor. Sometimes, when I want to read a document I&#8217;ll hook up the external monitor so that I can see a whole page at a time. Other times, when I&#8217;m using R, I&#8217;ll have the graphics window on the external and then the R console and Emacs on the main screen.

But my feeling is that when I&#8217;ve got more monitor real estate I&#8217;m less productive. I think it&#8217;s because I have the freedom to open more windows and to have more things going on. When I&#8217;ve got my laptop, I can only really afford to have 1 or 2 windows open. So I&#8217;m more focused on whatever I&#8217;m supposed to be doing. I also think this is one of the (small) reasons that people like things like the iPad. It&#8217;s a single application/single window device.

A quick Google search will find some <a href="http://www.unplggd.com/unplggd/roundup/roundup-multiple-monitor-homes-052915" target="_blank">pretty crazy multiple-monitor setups</a> out there. For some of them you&#8217;d think they were head of security at Los Angeles International Airport or something. And most people I know would scoff at the idea of working solely on your laptop while in the office. Partially, it&#8217;s an ergonomic issue. But maybe they just need an external monitor that&#8217;s 13 inches? I think I have one sitting in my basement somewhere&#8230;.
