Below is a plot of per capita GPD (in log scale) against years since women received the right to vote for 42 countries. Is this cause, effect, both or neither? We all know correlation does not imply causation, but I see many (non statistical) arguments to support both cause and effect here. Happy [International Women's Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Women's_Day) ! <a href="http://simplystatistics.org/2014/03/07/per-capita-gdp-versus-years-since-women-received-right-to-vote/rplot/" rel="attachment wp-att-2766"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2766" alt="Rplot" src="http://simplystatistics.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Rplot.png" width="983" height="591" srcset="http://simplystatistics.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Rplot-300x180.png 300w, http://simplystatistics.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Rplot.png 983w" sizes="(max-width: 983px) 100vw, 983px" /></a>

The data is from [here](http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0931343.html) and [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)_per_capita). I removed countries where women have had the right to vote for less than 20 years.

pd -What's with Switzerland?

update - R^2 and p-value added to graph
