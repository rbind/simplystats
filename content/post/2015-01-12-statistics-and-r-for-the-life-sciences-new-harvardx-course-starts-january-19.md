The first course of our Biomedical Data Science online curriculum
  
starts next week. You can sign up [here](https://www.edx.org/course/statistics-r-life-sciences-harvardx-ph525-1x). Instead of relying on
  
mathematical formulas to teach statistical concepts, students can
  
program along as we show computer code for simulations that illustrate
  
the main ideas of exploratory data analysis and statistical inference
  
(p-values, confidence intervals and power calculations for example).
  
By doing this, students will learn Statistics and R simultaneously and
  
will not be bogged down by having to memorize formulas. We have three types of learning modules: lectures (see picture below), screencasts and assessments. After each
  
video students will have the opportunity to assess their understanding
  
through homeworks involving coding in R. A big improvement over the
  
first version is that we have added dozens of assessment.

Note that this course is the first in an [eight part series](http://simplystatistics.org/2014/03/31/data-analysis-for-genomic-edx-course/) on Data Analysis for Genomics. Updates will be provided via twitter [@rafalab](https://twitter.com/rafalab).
