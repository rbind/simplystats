The links are back! Read on.

  1. <span style="line-height: 15.994318008422852px;">Susan Murphy - a statistician - <a href="http://ns.umich.edu/new/multimedia/videos/21711-u-m-professor-susan-murphy-earns-prestigious-macarthur-fellowship">wins a Macarthur Award</a>. Great for the field of statistics (via Dan S. and Simina B., among others).</span>
  2. Related: an <a style="font-size: 16px;" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heWEDx1gbB0">Interview with David Donoho</a> about the Shaw Prize. Statisticians are blowing up! (via Rafa)
  3. Hope that the award winners [don't lose momentum](http://www.nber.org/papers/w19445)! (via Andrew J.)
  4. Hopkins grad students [take to the Baltimore Sun](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/oped/bs-ed-biomedical-research,0,6244826.story) to report yet more ongoing negative effects of sequestration. Particularly appropriate in light of the current mayhem around keeping the government open. (via Rafa)
  5. Great [BBC piece](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OQvGvQAI7A) featuring David Spiegelhalter on the science of chance. I rarely watch Youtube videos that long all the way through, but I made it to the end of this one.
  6. Love how Yahoo finance has recognized the agonized cries of statisticians and [is converting pie charts to bar charts](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/where-americans-rich-poor-spent-193609849.html). (via Rafa - [who has actually given up on the issue](http://simplystatistics.org/2012/11/27/i-give-up-i-am-embracing-pie-charts/)).
  7. [Don't use Hadoop - your data aren't that big](http://www.chrisstucchio.com/blog/2013/hadoop_hatred.html).
  8. Don't forget to [sign up](https://plus.google.com/events/cd94ktf46i1hbi4mbqbbvvga358) for the future of statistics unconference October 30th Noon-1pm eastern. We have an awesome lineup of speakers and over 500 people RSVP'd on google plus alone. It's going to be a thing.
