Not only are data analytics companies getting scooped up left and right, &#8220;data science&#8221; is blowing up as a career. Data science is sort of an amorphous term, like any hot topic (e.g., <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing" target="_blank">cloud computing</a>). Regardless, people who can crunch numbers and find patterns are in high-demand, and I&#8217;m not the only <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/06/technology/06stats.html" target="_blank">one</a> <a href="http://www.cio.com/article/684344/The_6_Hottest_New_Jobs_in_IT" target="_blank">saying</a> <a href="http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/09/06/data-scientist-the-hot-new-gig-in-tech/" target="_blank">so</a>.
