Today I got my copy of Amstat News and eagerly opened it before I realized it was not the issue with the salary survey&#8230;.

But the President&#8217;s Corner section had the <a href="http://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2012/05/31/prescorner/" target="_blank">following column on big data</a> by ASA president Robert Rodriguez.

> <span>Big Data is big news. It is the focus of stories in </span>_The New York Times_<span> and the subject of technology blogs, business forums, and economic studies. This column describes how statisticians can prepare for opportunities in Big Data and explains the distinctive value our profession can provide.</span>

Here&#8217;s a homework assignment for you all: Please read the column and explain what&#8217;s wrong with it. I&#8217;ll post the answer in a (near) future post.
