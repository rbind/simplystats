_Editor's note: This is a repost of a previous Simply Statistics column that seems to be relevant again in light of Marie Davidian's [really important column](http://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2013/09/01/peerreview/) on the peer review process. You should also check out [Yihui's thoughts on this](http://yihui.name/en/2012/03/a-really-fast-statistics-journal/), which verge on the creation of a very fast/dynamic stats journal.  _

I know we need a new journal like we need a good poke in the eye. But I got fired up by the recent discussion of open science (by <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/17/open-science-and-the-econoblogosphere/" target="_blank">Paul Krugman</a> and others) and the seriously misguided <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Works_Act" target="_blank">Research Works Act</a>- that aimed to make it illegal to deposit published papers funded by the government in Pubmed central or other open access databases.

<div>
  I also realized that I spend a huge amount of time/effort on the following things: (1) waiting for reviews (typically months), (2) addressing reviewer comments that are unrelated to the accuracy of my work - just adding citations to referees papers or doing additional simulations, and (3) resubmitting rejected papers to new journals - this is a huge time suck since I have to reformat, etc. Furthermore, If I want my papers to be published open-access I also realized I have to pay at minimum <a href="http://simplystatistics.tumblr.com/post/12286350206/free-access-publishing-is-awesome-but-expensive-how" target="_blank">$1,000 per paper</a>.So I thought up my criteria for an ideal statistics journal. It would be accurate, have fast review times, and not discriminate based on how interesting an idea is. I have found that my most interesting ideas are the hardest ones to get published.  This journal would:</p> 
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Be open-access and free to publish your papers there. You own the copyright on your work.
    </li>
    <li>
      The criteria for publication would be: (1) it has to do with statistics, computation, or data analysis, (2) is the work is technically correct.
    </li>
    <li>
      We would accept manuals, reports of new statistical software, and full length research articles.
    </li>
    <li>
      There would be no page limits/figure limits.
    </li>
    <li>
      The journal would be published exclusively online.
    </li>
    <li>
      We would guarantee reviews within 1 week and publication immediately upon review if criteria (1) and (2) are satisfied
    </li>
    <li>
      Papers would receive a star rating from the editor - 0-5 stars. There would be a place for readers to also review articles
    </li>
    <li>
      All articles would be published with a tweet/like button so they can be easily distributed
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <div>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    To achieve such a fast review time, here is how it would work. We would have a large group of Associate Editors (hopefully 30 or more). When a paper was received, it would be assigned to an AE. The AEs would agree to referee papers within 2 days. They would use a form like this:
  </div>
  
  <div>
  </div>
  
  <blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Review of: Jeff’s Paper
      </li>
      <li>
        Technically Correct: Yes
      </li>
      <li>
        About statistics/computation/data analysis: Yes
      </li>
      <li>
        Number of Stars: 3 stars
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        3 Strengths of Paper (1 required):
      </li>
      <li>
        This paper revolutionizes statistics
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        3 Weakness of Paper (1 required):
      </li>
      <li>
        * The proof that this paper revolutionizes statistics is pretty weak
      </li>
      <li>
        because he only includes one example.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
  
  <div>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    That’s it, super quick, super simple, so it wouldn’t be hard to referee. As long as the answers to the first two questions were yes, it would be published.
  </div>
  
  <div>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    So now here’s my questions:
  </div>
  
  <div>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Would you ever consider submitting a paper to such a journal?
      </li>
      <li>
        Would you be willing to be one of the AEs for such a journal?
      </li>
      <li>
        Is there anything you would change?
      </li>
    </ol>
  </div>
</div>
