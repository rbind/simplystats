  1. [What it feels like to be bad at math](http://mathwithbaddrawings.com/2013/04/25/were-all-bad-at-math-1-i-feel-stupid-too/). My personal experience like this culminated in some difficulties [with Green's functions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green's_function) back in my early days at USU. I think almost everybody who does enough math eventually runs into a situation where they don't understand what is going on and it stresses them out.
  2. [An article](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/28/technology/how-big-data-is-playing-recruiter-for-specialized-workers.html?_r=0) about companies that are using data to try to identify people for jobs (via Rafa).
  3. [Google trends for predicting the market](http://www.forbes.com/sites/davidleinweber/2013/04/26/big-data-gets-bigger-now-google-trends-can-predict-the-market/). I'm not sure that "predicting" is the right word here. I think a better word might be "explaining/associating". I also wonder if [this could go off the rails](http://www.nature.com/news/when-google-got-flu-wrong-1.12413).

My favorite part of it is that it starts with the "why". Exactly. [Premature optimization is the root of all evi](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth)l.
  5. [A discussion of data science at Tumblr](http://blog.mortardata.com/post/47549853491/data-science-at-tumblr). The author/speaker [also has a great blog](http://www.adamlaiacano.com/).
