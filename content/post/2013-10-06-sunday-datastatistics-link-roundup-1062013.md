  1. <span style="line-height: 16px;"><a href="http://www.gwern.net/The%20Existential%20Risk%20of%20Mathematical%20Error">A fascinating read</a> about applying decision theory to mathematical proofs. They talk about Type I and Type II errors and everything. </span>
  2. Statistical concepts [explained through dance](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFjaBh12C6s&list=PLCkLQOAPOtT2H1hJRUxUYOxThRwfVI9jI&index=1). Even for a pretty culture-deficient dude like me this is cool.
  3. Lots of good talks from the [WIN Workshop](http://www.winworkshop.net/videos.php), including by one of our speakers for the [Unconference on the Future of Statistics](https://plus.google.com/events/cd94ktf46i1hbi4mbqbbvvga358).
  4. The best advice for graduate students (or any academics) I have seen in my time writing the Sunday Links. [You must try, and then you must ask](https://blogs.akamai.com/2013/10/you-must-try-and-then-you-must-ask.html) (via Seth F.).
  5. Alberto C. has a MOOC on [infographics and visualization](http://www.thefunctionalart.com/2013/09/the-third-introduction-to-infographics.html) that looks pretty cool. That way you can [avoid this kind of thing](http://xkcd.com/1273/).
  6. [This picture is awesome](https://twitter.com/AstroKatie/status/386757429351813120/photo/1). Nothing to do with statistics. (via @AstroKatie).
  7. If you aren't reading Thomas L.'s [notstatschat](http://notstatschat.tumblr.com/), you should be.
  8. Karl B. has an interesting [presentation on open access](http://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/presentations/openaccess.pdf) that is itself open access. First Beamer theme I've seen that didn't make me want to cover my eyes in sadness. My only problem is I wish open access publishing [wasn't so expensive](http://simplystatistics.org/2011/11/03/free-access-publishing-is-awesome-but-expensive-how/). Can't we just use a blog/[figshare](http://figshare.com/) to publish journals that are almost as good. [This dude](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6154/66.full?sid=cb2de807-61a8-4dda-ba15-3b4c76e0c627&utm_content=buffer8aaf1&utm_source=buffer&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=Buffer) says peer review is old news anyway.
