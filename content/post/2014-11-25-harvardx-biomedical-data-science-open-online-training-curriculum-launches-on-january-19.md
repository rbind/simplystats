We recently received [We recently received ](http://bd2k.nih.gov/FY14/COE/COE.html#sthash.ESkvsyrj.dpbs) initiative to develop MOOCs for biomedical data science. Our first offering will be version 2 of my [Data Analysis for Genomics course](http://simplystatistics.org/2014/03/31/data-analysis-for-genomic-edx-course/) which will launch on January 19. In this version, the course will be turned into an 8 course series and you can get a certificate in each one of them. The motivation for doing this is to go more in-depth into the different topics and to provide different entry points for students with different levels of expertise. We provide four courses on concepts and skills and four case-study based course. We basically broke the original class into the following eight parts:

  1. [Statistics and R for the Life Sciences](https://www.edx.org/course/statistics-with-r-for-life-sciences-harvardx-ph525-1x#.VHTQgmTF86B)
  2. [Introduction to Linear Models and Matrix Algebra](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-linear-models-and-matrix-algebra-harvardx-ph525-2x#.VHTQxGTF86B)
  3. [Advanced Statistics for the Life Sciences](https://www.edx.org/course/advanced-statistics-for-the-life-sciences-harvardx-ph525-3x#.VHTQ0GTF86B)
  4. [Introduction to Bioconductor](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-bioconductor-harvardx-ph525-4x#.VHTQ22TF86B)
  5. [Case study: RNA-seq data analysis](https://www.edx.org/course/case-study-rna-seq-data-analysis-harvardx-ph525-5x#.VHTQ5mTF86B)
  6. [Case study: Variant Discovery and Genotyping](https://www.edx.org/course/case-study-variant-discovery-and-genotyping-harvardx-ph525-6x#.VHTQ-WTF86B)
  7. [Case study: ChIP-seq data analysis](https://www.edx.org/course/case-study-chip-seq-data-analysis-harvardx-ph525-7x#.VHTRBWTF86B)
  8. [Case study: DNA methylation data analysis](https://www.edx.org/course/case-study-dna-methylation-data-analysis-harvardx-ph525-8x#.VHTREmTF86B)

You can follow the links to enroll. While not required, some familiarity with R and Rstudio will serve you well so consider taking [Roger's R course](https://www.coursera.org/course/rprog) and Jeff's [Toolbox](https://www.coursera.org/course/datascitoolbox) course before delving into this class.

In years 2 and 3 we plan to introduce several other courses covering topics such as python for data analysis, probability, software engineering, and data visualization which will be taught by a collaboration between the departments of Biostatistics, Statistics and Computer Science at Harvard.

Announcements will be made here and on twitter: [@rafalab](https://twitter.com/rafalab)
