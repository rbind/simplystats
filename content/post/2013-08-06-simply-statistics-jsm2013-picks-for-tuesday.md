It seems like Monday was a big hit at JSM with Nate Silver's talk and all. Rafa estimates that there were about [1 million people there](https://twitter.com/rafalab/status/364480835577073664) (+/- 1 million). Ramnath Vaidyanathan has a nice summary of the [talk](http://storify.com/ramnathv/jsm-2013?utm_campaign=&utm_source=t.co&utm_content=storify-pingback&awesm=sfy.co_hPE1&utm_medium=sfy.co-twitter) and the [Q&A](https://gist.github.com/ramnathv/975b7d5df642c3804fc5) afterwards. Among other things, Silver encouraged people to start a blog and communicate directly with the public. Couldn't agree more! Thanks to all who live-tweeted at #JSM2013. I felt like I was there.

On to Tuesday! Here's where I'd like to go:

  * <span style="line-height: 16px;">8:30-10:20am: <b>Spatial Uncertainty in Public Health Problems </b>(CC-513b); and since Nate says education is the next important area, <b>Statistical Knowledge for Teaching: Research Results and Implications for Professional Development</b> (CC-520d)</span>
  * 10:30am-12:20pm: Check out the latest in causal inference at **Fresh Perspectives on Causal Inference**** **(CC-512f) and come see the future of statistics at the ****SBSS Student Paper Travel Award Winners II**** (CC-520d)
  * 2-3:50pm: There's a cast of all-stars over in the **Biased Epidemiological Study Designs: Opportunities and Challenges** (CC-511c) session and a visualization session with an interesting premise **Painting a Picture of Life in the United States** (CC-510a)
  * 4-5:50pm: Only two choices here, so take your pick (or flip a coin).
