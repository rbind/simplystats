  1. [Tesla is hiring a data scientist](http://ch.tbe.taleo.net/CH07/ats/careers/requisition.jsp?org=TESLA&cws=1&rid=12268). That is all.
  2. I'm not sure I buy [the idea](http://www.talyarkoni.org/blog/2013/11/18/the-homogenization-of-scientific-computing-or-why-python-is-steadily-eating-other-languages-lunch/) [that Python](http://readwrite.com/2013/11/25/python-displacing-r-as-the-programming-language-for-data-science?utm_medium=readwr.it-twitter&utm_source=t.co&utm_content=awesmsharetools-sharebuttons&awesm=readwr.it_p0jm&utm_campaign=#awesm=~osWcapOVQuLAaP) is taking over for R among people who actually do regular data science.  I think it is still context dependent. A huge fraction of genomics happens in R and there is a steady stream of new packages that allow R users to push farther and farther back into the processing pipeline. On the other hand, I think language diversity is clearly a plus for someone who works with data. Not that I'd know...
  3. This is an awesome talk on [why to pursue a Ph.D.](http://vimeo.com/80236275). It gives a really level headed and measured discussion, specifically focused on computational programs (I think I got to it via Alyssa F.'s blog).
  4. En Español - [A blog post](http://www.elnuevodia.com/paraentenderlageneticalatina-1689123.html?fb_action_ids=10100207969753748) about a study of genetic risk factors among Hispanic/Latino populations (via Rafa).
  5. [Where have all the tenured women gone?](http://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2014/01/01/tenured-women/) This is a major issue and deserves much more press than it gets (via Sherri R.).
  6. <span style="line-height: 16px;">Not related to statistics really, <a href="http://9-eyes.com/">but these image captures</a> from Google streetview are wild. </span>
