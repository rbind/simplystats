<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.0530" target="_blank">The paper</a> is a review of how to do software development for academics. I saw it via C. Titus Brown (who <a href="http://simplystatistics.org/post/29620679415/interview-with-c-titus-brown-computational-biologist" target="_blank">we have interviewed</a>), he is also a co-author. How to write software (particularly for other people) is something that is under emphasized in many curricula. But it turns out this is also one of the more important components of disseminating your work in modern applied statistics. My only wish is that there was an accompanying website with resources/links for people to chase down.
