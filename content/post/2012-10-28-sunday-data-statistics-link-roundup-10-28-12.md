  1. An important article about <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=antiscience-beliefs-jeopardize-us-democracy" target="_blank">anti-science sentiment</a> in the U.S. (via David S.). The politicization of scientific issues such as global warming, evolution, and healthcare (think vaccination) makes the U.S. less competitive. I think the lack of statistical literacy and training in the U.S. is one of the sources of the problem. People use/skew/mangle statistical analyses and experiments to support their view and without a statistically well trained public, it all looks &#8220;reasonable and scientific&#8221;. But when science seems to contradict itself, it loses credibility. Another reason to <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/arthur_benjamin_s_formula_for_changing_math_education.html" target="_blank">teach statistics to everyone in high school.</a>
  2. Scientific American was loaded this last week, here is another <a href="http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/2012/10/18/nihmim12-the-spreading-shadow-of-cancer-angst-3-things-you-need-to-know-to-meet-it-rationally/" target="_blank">article on cancer screening</a>.  The article covers several of the issues that make it hard to convince people that screening isn&#8217;t always good. The predictive value of the positive confusion is a huge one in cancer screening right now. The author of the piece is someone worth following on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/hildabast" target="_blank">@</a><span><a href="https://twitter.com/hildabast" target="_blank">hildabast</a>.</span>
  3. <span><a href="http://www.githubarchive.org/" target="_blank">A bunch of data</a> on the use of Github. Always cool to see new data sets that are worth playing with for student projects, etc. (via Hilary M.). </span>
  4. <span>A really interesting post over at Stats Chat about <a href="http://www.statschat.org.nz/2012/10/28/why-we-study-the-obvious/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+StatsChat+%28Stats+Chat%29" target="_blank">why we study seemingly obvious things</a>. Hint, the reason is that &#8220;obvious&#8221; things aren&#8217;t always true. </span>
  5. <span>A <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2012/10/23/163434283/how-much-is-a-like-on-facebook-worth-for-a-companys-share-price" target="_blank">story on &#8220;sentiment analysis&#8221; </a>by NPR that suggests that most of the variation in a stock&#8217;s price during the day can be explained by the number of Facebook likes. Obviously, this is an interesting correlation. Probably more interesting for hedge funders/stockpickers if the correlation was with the change in stock price the next day. (via Dan S.)</span>
  6. <span>Yihui Xie visited our department this week. We had a great time chatting with him about knitr/animation and all the cool work he is doing. <a href="http://yihui.name/slides/2012-reproduce-homework.html" target="_blank">Here are his slides</a> from the talk he gave. Particularly check out his idea for a fast journal. You are seeing the future of publishing.  </span>
