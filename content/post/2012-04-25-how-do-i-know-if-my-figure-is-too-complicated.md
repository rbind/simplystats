One of the key things every statistician needs to learn is how to create informative figures and graphs. Sometimes, it is easy to use off-the-shelf plots like barplots, histograms, or if one is truly desperate a <a href="http://simplystatistics.tumblr.com/post/21611701077/sunday-data-statistics-link-roundup-4-22" target="_blank">pie-chart</a>. 

But sometimes the information you are trying to communicate requires the development of a new graphic. I am currently working on a project with a graduate student where the standard illustration are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venn_diagram" target="_blank">Venn Diagrams</a> - including complicated Venn Diagrams with 5 or 10 circles. 

As we were thinking about different ways of illustrating our data, I started thinking about what are the key qualities of a graphic and how do I know if it is too complicated. I realized that:

  1. Ideally just looking at the graphic one can intuitively understand what is going on, but sometimes for more technical/involved displays this isn&#8217;t possible
  2. Alternatively, I think a good plot should be able to be explained in 2 sentences or less. I think that is true for pretty much every plot I use regularly. 
  3. That isn&#8217;t including describing what different colors/sizes/shapes specifically represent in any particular version of the graphic. 

I feel like there is probably something to this in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Grammar-Graphics-Leland-Wilkinson/dp/0387987746" target="_blank">Grammar of Graphics</a> or in some of <a href="http://www.stat.purdue.edu/~wsc/papersbooks.pdf" target="_blank">William Cleveland&#8217;s</a> work. But this is one of the first times I&#8217;ve come up with a case where a new, generalizable, type of graph needs to be developed.
