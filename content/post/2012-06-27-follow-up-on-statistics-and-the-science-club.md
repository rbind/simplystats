I agree with Roger&#8217;s latest <a href="http://simplystatistics.org/post/25643791866/statistics-and-the-science-club" target="_blank">post</a>: &#8220;we<span> need to expand the tent of statistics and include people who are using their statistical training to lead the new science&#8221;. I am perhaps a bit more worried than Roger. </span>Specifically, I worry that talented go-getters interested in leading science via data analysis will achieve this without engaging our research community. 

A  quantitatively trained person (engineers , computer scientists, physicists, etc..) with strong computing skills (knows python, C, and shell scripting), that reads, for example, &#8220;Elements of Statistical Learning&#8221; and learns R, is well on their way. Eventually, many of these users of Statistics will become developers and if we don&#8217;t keep up then what do they need from us? Our already-written books may be enough. In fact, in genomics, I know several people like this that are already developing novel statistical methods. I want these researchers to be part of our academic departments. Otherwise, I fear we will not be in touch with the problems and data that lead to, quoting Roger, &#8220;the most exciting developments of our lifetime.&#8221;
