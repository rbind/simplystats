Here are my picks for ENAR sessions today (Wednesday):

  * 8:30-10:15am: **Large Data Visualization and Exploration**, Grand Ballroom 4 (make sure you stay till the end to see Karl Broman); **Innovative Methods in Causal Inference with Applications to Mediation, Neuroimaging, and Infectious Diseases**, Grand Ballroom 8A; **Next Generation Sequencing**, Grand Ballroom 5
  * 10:30am-12:15pm: **Statistical Information Integration of -Omics Data**, Grand Ballrooms 1 & 2

Okay, so this schedule actually requires me to split myself in to three separate entities. However, if you find a way to do that, the 8:30-10:15am block is full of good stuff.

Have fun!
