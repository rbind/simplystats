A cool article <a href="http://singularityhub.com/2011/08/29/pre-cog-is-real-%E2%80%93-new-software-stops-crime-before-it-happens/" target="_blank">here</a> on a group predicting the place/time when crime is going to happen. It looks like they are using a Poisson process. They liken it to predicting the after shocks of an earthquake. More details on the math behind the pre-cog software can be found <a href="http://math.scu.edu/~gmohler/crime_project.html" target="_blank">here</a>. I wonder what their prediction accuracy is?  Thanks to Rafa for pointing the link out.
