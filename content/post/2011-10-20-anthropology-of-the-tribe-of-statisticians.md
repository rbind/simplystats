From the BBC a pretty fascinating radio <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b013851z/The_Tribes_of_Science_More_Tribes_of_Science_The_Statisticians/" target="_blank">piece.</a>

> &#8230;in the same way that a telescope enables you to see things that are too far away to see with the naked eye, a microscope enables you to see things that are too small to see with the naked eye, _statistics_ enables you to see things in masses of data which are too complex for you to see with the naked eye.
