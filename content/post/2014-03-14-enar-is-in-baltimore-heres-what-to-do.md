This year's meeting of the Eastern North American Region of the International Biometric Society (ENAR) is in lovely Baltimore, Maryland. As local residents Jeff and I thought we'd put down a few suggestions for what to do during your stay here in case you're not familiar with the area.

**Venue**

The conference is being held at the Marriott in the Harbor East area of the city, which is relatively new and a great location. There are a number of good restaurants right in the vicinity, including [Wit & Wisdom](http://www.witandwisdombaltimore.com) in the Four Seasons hotel across the street and [Pabu](http://www.pabuizakaya.com), an excellent Japanese restaurant that I personally believe is the best restaurant in Baltimore (a very close second is [Woodberry Kitchen](http://www.woodberrykitchen.com), which is a bit farther away near Hampden). If you go to Pabu, just don't get sushi; try something new for a change. Around Harbor East you'll also find a [Cinghiale](http://www.cgeno.com) (excellent northern Italian restaurant), [Charleston](http://www.charlestonrestaurant.com) (expensive southern food), [Lebanese Taverna](http://www.lebanesetaverna.com/lebanese-restaurant-baltimore-md.html), and [Ouzo Bay](http://www.ouzobay.com). If you're sick of restaurants, there's also a Whole Foods. If you want a great breakfast, you can walk just a few blocks down Aliceanna street to the [Blue Moon Cafe](http://bluemoonbaltimore.com). Get the eggs Benedict. If you get the Cap'n Crunch French toast, you will need a nap afterwards.

Just east of Harbor East is an area called Fell's Point. This is commonly known as the "bar district" and it lives up to its reputation. [Max's](http://www.maxs.com) in Fell's Point (on the square) has an obscene number of beers on tap. The [Heavy Seas Alehouse](http://heavyseasalehouse.com) on Central Avenue has some excellent beers from the local Heavy Seas brewery and also has great food from chef [Matt Seeber](https://twitter.com/Matt_Seeber). Finally, the [Daily Grind](http://www.fellsgrind.com/Index.aspx) coffee shop is a local institution.

**Around the Inner Harbor**

Outside of the immediate Harbor East area, there are a number of things to do. For kids, there's [Port Discovery](http://www.portdiscovery.org/index.cfm?), which my 3-year-old son seems to really enjoy. There's also the [National Aquarium](http://aqua.org) where the Tuesday networking event will be held. This is also a great place for kids if you're bringing family. There's a neat [little park on Pier 6](https://www.google.com/maps/place/39°17'07.5%22N+76°36'20.4%22W/@39.285406,-76.605667,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x0) that is small, but has a number of kid-related things to do. It's a nice place to hang out when the weather is nice. Around the other side of the harbor is the [Maryland Science Center](http://www.mdsci.org), another kid-fun place, and just west of the Harbor down Pratt Street is the [B&O Railroad Museum](http://www.borail.org), which I think is good for both kids and adults (I like trains).

Unfortunately, at this time there's no football or baseball to watch.

**Around Baltimore**

There are a lot of really interesting things to check out around Baltimore if you have the time. If you need to get around downtown and the surrounding areas there's the [Charm City Circulator](http://www.charmcitycirculator.com) which is a free bus that runs every 15 minutes or so. The Mt. Vernon district has a number of cultural things to do. For classical music fans there's the wonderful [Baltimore Symphony Orchestra](http://bsomusic.org) directed by Marin Alsop. The [Peabody Institute](http://www.peabody.jhu.edu) often has some interesting concerts going on given by the students there. There's the [Walters Art Museum](http://thewalters.org), which is free, and has a very interesting collection. There are also a number of good restaurants and coffee shops in Mt. Vernon, like [Dooby's](http://www.doobyscoffee.com) (excellent dinner) and [Red Emma's](https://redemmas.org)  (lots of Noam Chomsky).

That's all I can think of right now. If you have other questions about Baltimore while you're here for ENAR tweet us up at @simplystats.
