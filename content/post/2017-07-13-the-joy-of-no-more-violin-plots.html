<p>I dislike violin plots because they look like Christmas ornaments.</p>

<p>It’s a pet peeve but there is somewhat of a practical reason as well. To demonstrate I created a dataset called <code>dat</code> that contains an outcome <code>value</code> for from 25 different groups.</p>
<p>One of the first steps I take when analyzing data is to look at the distribution of my data. If there are groups, I like to stratify and look at the distributions. Histograms and smooth density estimates are my favorite tools for visualizing distributions. I have 25 groups in this data so I would start by quickly looking at a random subset:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dat %&gt;% filter(group %in% c(&quot;A&quot;,&quot;H&quot;,&quot;I&quot;,&quot;P&quot;)) %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(value)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5, color=&quot;black&quot;) +
  facet_grid(.~group)</code></pre>

<p>This plot shows me that the data looks normally distributed. To see how the groups compare to each other, a first step is to look at boxplots with groups reordered by their median value.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dat %&gt;% mutate(group = reorder(group, value, median)) %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(group, value)) + geom_boxplot()</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2017-07-13-the-joy-of-no-more-violin-plots_files/figure-html/boxplots-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>If you look close enough you note that group G looks a bit different: larger variance. But by summarizing into only five numbers, the boxplot misses an important characteristic of the data. Violin points lets you see the distributions rather than these five points:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dat %&gt;% mutate(group = reorder(group, value, median)) %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(group, value)) + geom_violin(fill = &quot;blue&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2017-07-13-the-joy-of-no-more-violin-plots_files/figure-html/violin-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Do you see it? If you look closely group G appears to be bimodal. But why is it hard for me to see?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Adding a mirror image of the density to make them resemble boxplots in some manner makes them look like Christmas ornaments and distracts me.</li>
<li>I am used to looking at histograms and densities with the variable in the x-axis not the y-axis.</li>
</ol>
<p>I therefore prefer to stack histograms or density estimators vertically. So I was happy to learn about the <a href="https://github.com/clauswilke/ggjoy">ggjoy</a> package that let’s you make such a plot in one line of code and produces a much more aesthetically pleasing plot than stacking histograms using, for example, facets.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(ggjoy)
dat %&gt;% mutate(group = reorder(group, value, median)) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x=value, y=group, height=..density..)) +
  geom_joy(scale=0.85)</code></pre>

<p>Note how quickly we notice the bimodal group. I am hoping people start using joy plots instead of violin plots. Try out the package:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(devtools)
install_github(&quot;clauswilke/ggjoy&quot;)</code></pre>
