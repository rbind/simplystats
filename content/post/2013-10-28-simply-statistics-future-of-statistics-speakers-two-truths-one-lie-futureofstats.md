Our online conference live-streamed on Youtube is going to happen on October 30th 12PM-1PM Baltimore (UTC-4:00) time. You can find more information [here](http://simplystatistics.org/unconference) or sign up for email alerts [here](https://plus.google.com/events/cd94ktf46i1hbi4mbqbbvvga358). I get bored with the usual speaker bios at conferences so I am turning our speaker bios into a game. Below you will find three bullet pointed items of interest about each of our speakers. Two of them are truths and one is a lie. See if you can spot the lies and [sign up for the unconference](https://plus.google.com/events/cd94ktf46i1hbi4mbqbbvvga358)!
