Some NIH R01 paylines are <a href="http://www.einstein.yu.edu/ogs/page.aspx?id=21983" target="_blank">down to 10%</a>. This means only 10% of grants are being funded. The plot below highlights that all we need is a tiny litte slice from Defense, Medicare, Medicaid or Social Security to bring that back up to 20%. The plot was taken from Alex Tarrabok&#8217;s <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/01/the-innovation-nation-vs-the-warfare-welfare-state/251984/" target="_blank">great article</a> in the Atlantic.<img height="231" src="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/business/innovation%20welfarewarfare.png" width="377" />

**Update**: The y-axis unit is billions of US dollars.
