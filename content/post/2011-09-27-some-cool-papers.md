  1. A cool article on the r<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/108/31/12647.abstract" target="_blank">egulator&#8217;s dilemma</a>. It turns out what is the best risk profile to prevent one bank from failing is not the best risk profile to prevent all banks from failing. 
  2. <a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0024914" target="_blank">Persistence of web resources</a> for computational biology. I think this one is particularly relevant for academic statisticians since a lot of academic software/packages are developed by graduate students. Once they move on, a large chunk of &#8220;institutional knowledge&#8221; is lost. 
  3. <a href="http://kevindenny.wordpress.com/2011/08/08/are-private-schools-better-than-public-schools-evidence-for-ireland/" target="_blank">Are private schools better than public schools</a>? A quote from the paper: &#8220;Indeed when comparing the average score in the two types of schools after adjusting for the enrollment effects, we find quite surprisingly that public schools perform better on average.
