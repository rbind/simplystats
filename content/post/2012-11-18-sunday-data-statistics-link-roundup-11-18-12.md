  1. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipk3HIIG9-o&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">An interview</a> with Brad Efron about scientific writing. I haven&#8217;t watched the whole interview, but I do know that Efron is one of my favorite writers among statisticians.
  2. <a href="http://ramnathv.github.com/slidify/" target="_blank">Slidify,</a> another approach for making HTML5 slides directly from R.  I love the idea of making HTML slides, I would definitely do this regularly. But there are a couple of issues I feel still aren&#8217;t resolved: (1) It is still just a little too hard to change the theme/feel of the slides in my opinion. It is just CSS, but that&#8217;s still just enough of a hurdle that it is keeping me away and (2) I feel that the placement/insertion of images is still a little clunky, Google Docs has figured this out, I&#8217;d love it if they integrated the best features of Slidify, Latex, etc. into that system. 
  3. Statistics is still the new hotness. Here is a Business Insider list about 5 statistics problems that will <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/five-statistics-problems-that-will-change-the-way-you-see-the-world-2012-11" target="_blank">&#8220;change the way you think about the world&#8221;</a>. 
  4. I love this one in the <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/humor/2012/11/19/121119sh_shouts_rudnick" target="_blank">New Yorker</a>, especially the line,&#8221;<span>statisticians are the new sexy vampires, only even more pasty&#8221; (via Brooke A.)</span><span><br /></span>
  5. <span>We&#8217;ve hit the big time! We have <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevensalzberg/2012/11/12/the-election-is-over-and-the-math-geeks-won/" target="_blank">been linked to</a> by a real (Forbes) blogger. </span>
  6. <span>If you haven&#8217;t noticed, we have a <a href="http://simplystatistics.org/post/35842154215/logo-contest-winner" target="_blank">new logo</a>. We are going to be making a few other platform-related changes over the next week or so. If you have any trouble, let us know!</span>
