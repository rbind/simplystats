Johns Hopkins is a pretty amazing place to do computational genomics right now. My colleagues are really impressive, for example [five of our faculty are part of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/five_johns_hopkins_scientists_among_83_who_will_share_in_15_million_award_from_chan_zuckerberg_initiative_to_fund_computer_based_research_on_human_cells) and we have faculty across a range of departments including Biostatistics, Computer Science, Biology, Biomedical Engineering, Human Genetics. A number of my colleagues are activitely looking for postdocs and in an effort to make the postdoc job market a little less opaque I'm listing this non-comprehensive list of opportunities I know about here. 

**Job:** Postdoc(s) in methods development for precision medicine in oncology and immunotherapy (single cell RNA-seq, TCR sequencing).

**Employer:** Elana Fertig and Elizabeth Jaffee

**To apply:** [email Elana](https://fertiglab.com/opportunities)

**Deadline:** Review ongoing

===============



**Job:** Timp lab is hiring postdocs!  We work on sequencing technology and analysis development for direct RNA seq, epigenetics, cancer genomics, infectious disease diagnosis, non-model organism genomics, protein sequencing and all of the above!

**Employer:** Winston Timp

**To apply:** [email Winston](https://www.timplab.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/180420_postdoc_ad.pdf)

**Deadline:** Until position filled

===============

**Job:** The Goff lab ([www.gofflab.org](http://www.gofflab.org)) has 2 open postdoc positions for a variety of projects at the intersection of computational biology and neurodevelopment, degeneration, and disease.  We develop and utilize single cell analysis techniques, including single cell RNA-Seq, to explore cell state transitions across continuous biological processes. Current funded projects include cross-model analysis of fALS, Parkinson Disease, and Kabuki Syndrome, as well as examination of cell-type-specific neuronal plasticity response, and developmental fate specification in the CNS.

**Employer:** Loyal Goff and Solange Brown

**To apply:** [email Loyal](mailto:loyalgoff@jhmi.edu)

**Deadline:** 12/31/2018 or until position filled

===============

**Job:** The Hansen lab ([www.hansenlab.org](http://www.hansenlab.org)) is hiring postdocs in computational biology. We are funded to continue development of the [recount2](https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.3838) ([preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/068478)) project, which involves joint processing, normalization, and analysis of all publicly available human RNA-seq samples. This project combines genomics with analysis of extremely large-scale RNA-seq data. The work is in collaboration with [Jeff Leek](http://www.jtleek.com), [Ben Langmead](www.langmead-lab.org) and [Alexis Battle](battlelab.jhu.edu) at JHU.

**Emplyer:** Kasper D. Hansen

**To apply:** Email Kasper.

**Deadline:** Review ongoing

===============

**Job:** The Jaffe lab at the Lieber Institute for Brain Develpoment (affiliated with JHMI) is hiring at several different levels (research assistant, research associate, postdoc fellow)!  We work at the intersection of genomics, biostatistics, and computational biology, leveraging large human brain datasets to better understand how genomic signatures associate with brain development and subsequent dysregulation in mental illness.

**Employer:** Andrew Jaffe

**To apply:** [LIBD Careers](https://libd.org/careers/)

**Deadline:** Until position filled

===============

**Job:** The Battle lab ([battlelab.jhu.edu](battlelab.jhu.edu)) is hiring postdocs in genomics and machine learning/probabilistic modeling.  Projects include rare genetic variation, single cell genomics, time series genomics, complex human disease, large scale integrative transcriptomic/eQTL studies, and more.  

**Employer:** Alexis Battle

**To apply:** [email Alexis](emailto:ajbattle@jhu.edu)

**Deadline:** Until positions filled
