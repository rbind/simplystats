  1. There has been a big knockdown-dragout battle in the blogosphere over how GTEX is doing their analysis. Read the original post [here](http://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2013/10/21/gtex/), my summary [here](http://simplystatistics.org/2013/10/22/blog-posts-that-impact-real-science-software-review-and-gtex/), and the [response from GTEX here.](http://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2013/10/31/response-to-gtex-is-throwing-away-90-of-their-data/) I agree that the criticism bordered on hyperbolic but also think that methods matter. I also think that consortia are under pressure to get something out and have to use software that works, I'm sympathetic cause that must be a tough position to be in, but it is important to remember software runs != software works well.
  2. Chris Bosh [thinks you should learn to code](http://www.businessinsider.com/chris-bosh-thinks-you-should-learn-how-to-code-2013-10). Me too. I wonder if the Heat will give me a contract now?
  3. Terry Speed wins the Prime Minister's Prize for science. Here is an [awesome interview](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-10-31/prime-ministers-prize-for-science-award-winner-terry-speed/5059718) with him. Watch to the end to find out how he is gonna spend all the money.
  4. Learn faster with the [Feynman technique](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrNqSLPaZLc). tl;dr = practice teaching what you are trying to learn.
  5. Via Tim T. Jr. check out this [interactive version](http://vudlab.com/simpsons/) of Simpson's paradox. Super slick and educational.
  6. [Stats used to determine](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1830249-golden-glove-awards-2013-full-list-of-winners-and-analysis) the Gold Glove (in part).
  7. [An angry newcomer's guide](https://github.com/tdsmith/aRrgh) to data types in R, dangit!
  8. [Accidental aRt](http://accidental-art.tumblr.com/) - accidentally beautiful creations in R.
