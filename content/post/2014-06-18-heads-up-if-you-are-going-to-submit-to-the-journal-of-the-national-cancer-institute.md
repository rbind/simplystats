**Update (6/19/14):** _The folks at JNCI and OUP have kindly confirmed that they will consider manuscripts that have been posted to preprint servers. _

I just got this email about a paper we submitted to JNCI

> Dear Dr. Leek:
> 
> I am sorry that we will not be able to use the above-titled manuscript. Unfortunately, the paper was published online on a site called bioRXiv, The Preprint Server for Biology, hosted by Cold Spring Harbor Lab. JNCI does not publish previously published work.
> 
> Thank you for your submission to the Journal.

I have to say I'm not totally surprised, but I am a little disappointed, the future of academic publishing [is definitely not evenly distributed](http://simplystatistics.org/2014/06/16/the-future-of-academic-publishing-is-here-it-just-isnt-evenly-distributed/).
