Facebook&#8217;s first quarterly earnings report as a public company is coming out this Thursday and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/23/technology/facebook-advertising-efforts-face-a-day-of-judgment.html" target="_blank">everyone&#8217;s wondering what will be in it</a>. One question is whether advertisers are going to Facebook over other sites like Google.

> <span>“Advertisers need more proof that actual advertising on Facebook offers a return on investment,” said Debra Aho Williamson, an analyst with </span>the market research firm eMarketer<span>. “There is such disagreement over whether Facebook is the next big thing on the Internet or whether it’s going to fail miserably.”</span>

> <span>Facebook’s unique asset is the pile of personal data it collects from 900 million users. But using that data to serve up effective, profitable advertisements is a daunting task. Google has been in the advertising game longer and has roughly $40 billion in annual revenue from advertising — 10 times that of Facebook. Since the public offering, Wall Street has tempered its expectations for Facebook’s advertising revenue, and shares closed Friday at $28.76, down from their initial price of $38.</span>

There&#8217;s a pretty fundamental question here: Does it work?

With all the data Facebook has at its fingertips, it would be a shame if they couldn&#8217;t answer that question.
