  1. <span style="line-height: 16px;">Some <a href="http://www.prana.com/life/2012/12/01/conscious-consumerism-how-do-your-brands-rate/">interesting data/data visualizations</a> about working conditions in the apparel industry. <a href="http://www.free2work.org/trends/apparel/?utm_source=Social%20Ventures&utm_medium=Hootsuite&utm_campaign=SV%20News%20Feed">Here</a> is the full report. Whenever I see reports like this, I wish the raw data were more clearly linked. I want to be able to get in, play with the data, and see if I notice something that doesn't appear in the infographics. </span>
  2. <span style="line-height: 16px;">This is an awesome <a href="http://wmbriggs.com/blog/?p=6465">plain-language discussion</a> of how a bunch of methods (CS and Stats) with fancy names relate to each other. It shows that CS/Machine Learning/Stats are converging in many ways and there isn't much new under the sun. On the other hand, I think the really exciting thing here is to use these methods on new questions, once people <a href="http://simplystatistics.org/2012/12/08/dropping-the-stick-in-data-analysis/">drop the stick</a>. </span>
  3. <span style="line-height: 16px;">If you are a reader of this blog and somehow do not read anything else on the internet, you will have missed Hadley Wickham's <a href="https://github.com/hadley/devtools/wiki/Rcpp">Rcpp tutorial</a>. In my mind, this pretty much seals it, Julia isn't going to overtake R anytime soon. In other news, Hadley is <a href="http://biostat.jhsph.edu/newsEvent/event/seminar/seminars.shtml">coming to visit</a> JHSPH Biostats this week! I'm psyched to meet him. </span>
  4. <span style="line-height: 16px;">For those of us that live in Baltimore, this <a href="http://www.r-bloggers.com/visualizing-baltimore-with-r-and-ggplot2-crime-data/">interesting set of data visualizations</a> lets you in on the crime hotspots. This is a much fancier/more thorough analysis than <a href="http://simplystatistics.org/2012/01/03/baltimore-gun-offenders-and-where-academics-dont-live/">Rafa and I did</a> way back when. </span>
  5. <span style="line-height: 16px;">Check out the new <a href="http://www.census.gov/easystats/">easy stats tool</a> from the Census (via Hilary M.) and read our interview with <a href="http://simplystatistics.org/2012/11/09/interview-with-tom-louis-new-chief-scientist-at-the/">Tom Louis</a> who is heading over there to the Census to do cool things. </span>
  6. <span style="line-height: 16px;"><a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2012/12/07/ted_to_tedx_how_to_avoid_bad_science_in_talks.html?utm_source=tw&utm_medium=sm&utm_campaign=button_toolbar">Watch out</a>, some Tedx talks may be pseudoscience! More later this week on the politicization/glamourization of science, so stay tuned. </span>
