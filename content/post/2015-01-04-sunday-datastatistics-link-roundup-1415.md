  1. I am digging [this visualization of your life in weeks](http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html). I might have to go so far as to actually make one for myself.
  2. I'm very excited about the new podcast [TalkingMachines](http://www.thetalkingmachines.com/) and what an awesome name! I wish someone would do that same thing for applied statistics (Roger?)
  3. I love that they call Ben Goldacre the [anti-Dr. Oz in this piece](http://www.vox.com/2014/12/27/7423229/ben-goldacre), especially given how often [Dr. Oz is telling the truth](http://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g7346).
  4. If you haven't read it yet, [this piece in the Economist](http://www.economist.com/news/christmas-specials/21636589-how-statisticians-changed-war-and-war-changed-statistics-they-also-served) on statisticians during the war is really good.
  5. The arXiv [celebrated it's 1M paper upload](http://www.nature.com/news/the-arxiv-preprint-server-hits-1-million-articles-1.16643). It costs less to run than the [top 2 executives at PLoS make](https://twitter.com/joe_pickrell/status/549762678160625664). It is t[oo darn expensive](http://simplystatistics.org/2011/11/03/free-access-publishing-is-awesome-but-expensive-how/) to publish open access right now.
