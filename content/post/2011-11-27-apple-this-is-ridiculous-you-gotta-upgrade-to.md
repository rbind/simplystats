So along with a few folks here around Hopkins we have been kicking around the idea of developing an app for the iPhone/Android. I&#8217;ll leave the details out for now (other than to say stay tuned!).

But to start developing an app for the iPhone, you need a version of <a href="http://developer.apple.com/xcode/" target="_blank">Xcode</a>, Apple&#8217;s development environment. The latest version of Xcode is version 4, which can only be installed with the latest version of Mac OS X Lion (10.7, I think) and above. So I dutifully went off to download Lion. Except, whoops! You can only download Lion from the Mac App store.

Now this wouldn&#8217;t be a problem, if you didn&#8217;t need OS X Snow Leopard (10.6 and above) to access the App store. Turns out I only have version 10.5 (must be OS X Housecat or something). I did a little searching and it <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3102124?start=0" target="_blank">looks like</a> the only way I can get Lion is if I buy Snow Leopard first and upgrade to upgrade!

It isn&#8217;t the money so much (although it does suck to pay $60 for $30 worth of software), but the time and inconvenience this causes. Apple has done this a couple of times to me in the past with operating systems needing to be upgraded so I can buy things from iTunes. But this is getting out of hand&#8230;.maybe I need to consider the <a href="http://www.google.com/chromebook/" target="_blank">alternatives</a>.
